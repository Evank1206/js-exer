In HTML: Make an h1 and give it a unique Id or class. Using Javascript, insert some text into that element.
In HTML: Create an input and give it a unique ID. Then create a button with an onclick attribute which invokes a function. Name this function whatever you’d like.
In JS: Declare your function and inside it, store the value of the input in a variable, with a name of your choice. The way this will work is, a user will type something into the input field and then click the button, which will invoke your function and store what they have typed in into a variable.
In JS: Add a console.log command to your function to also log the value of your variable to the console when the function runs. Test your function. Is the console correctly displaying what you typed into the input? If not, take a closer look at your function code and try to identify the issue.
In HTML: Create another h1 with a unique ID.
In JS: Add additional code to your function which takes your variable and inserts the text into the new h1. Now, when a user types into the input and clicks the button, they should see their text populate in an h1 elsewhere on your page.
In JS: Create a variable and store an array inside it of five strings. Using a for loop, log each string in the array to the console, one at a time.
In JS: Create an object with at least three separate properties and values. Log each property value to the console, one at a time (Note: do not use a for loop for this).
In HTML: Create three HTML heading elements, each with a unique ID.
In JS: Insert the value of one of your object’s property values into each new heading element.
In JS: Create a variable and store an array in it. In this array, create three objects, with three properties each. Using a for loop, log the property values of each object to the console.
In JS: Now write a line of code which changes all of the text inside your HTML body element to red (HINT: you can select your body element very easily with “document.body”).
